# AQI-Predictor Project Report

## Project Overview

I developed an Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction system that combines various data sources, advanced machine learning techniques, and modern MLOps practices. The goal was to create a reliable, automated system for forecasting air quality that could provide actionable insights for users. Here's a detailed overview of my implementation approach and the reasoning behind my technical decisions.

## My Implementation Approach

### Data Collection Strategy

In the `data_collection` directory, I implemented interfaces to two critical data sources:

- **AQICN API** (`aqicn_api.py`): I chose this source because it provides standardized air quality measurements from monitoring stations worldwide. Having access to historical AQI data was essential for training accurate prediction models.

- **OpenWeatherMap API** (`openweather_api.py`): I integrated weather data because meteorological factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure directly influence air quality. This additional data significantly improves the prediction accuracy of my models.

I designed `data_collector.py` to orchestrate the collection process, handling scheduling and initial data validation. By automating this process, I ensured a consistent flow of training data while minimizing manual intervention.

### Feature Engineering

The `feature_engineering` directory contains my approach to transforming raw data into model-ready features:

- In `feature_generator.py`, I implemented techniques to derive meaningful predictors from raw measurements. This includes calculating rolling averages, creating temporal features (day of week, hour of day), and engineering interaction terms between weather and pollution data.

- With `backfill.py`, I addressed the challenge of missing data in time series, which is common in environmental monitoring. This was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the time series without losing valuable training examples.

- For `feature_store.py`, I implemented integration with **Hopsworks Feature Store**, which was a key decision for several reasons:
  1. It provides version control for features, ensuring reproducibility
  2. It enables feature sharing across training and inference
  3. It reduces training-serving skew, a common problem in ML systems

Using Hopsworks for my feature store significantly improved my workflow efficiency and model reliability, as I could guarantee that the same feature transformations were applied consistently.

### Model Implementation

In the `models` directory, I implemented a diverse range of algorithms specifically chosen to capture different aspects of the AQI prediction problem:

#### 1. Neural Network Model

I implemented a sophisticated neural network architecture in `neural_net_model.py` with two variants:

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: For capturing complex non-linear relationships between features
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Specifically designed for the sequential nature of time series data

My neural network implementation includes:
- Dynamic layer configuration with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
- Early stopping callbacks to optimize training time
- Feature standardization through integrated scalers
- Flexible architecture that adapts based on the data characteristics

This implementation was particularly valuable for capturing complex patterns in the AQI data that simpler models might miss. The LSTM variant was especially effective for forecasting future AQI values based on temporal patterns.

#### 2. Gradient Boosting Regression Model

I implemented gradient boosting in `boosting_model.py` as it excels at:
- Handling heterogeneous features (both numerical weather data and categorical time features)
- Automatically capturing feature interactions
- Providing strong predictive performance through ensemble learning

The gradient boosting model often performed best in scenarios with clear non-linear relationships between weather conditions and AQI levels, making it a crucial component of my model selection strategy.

#### 3. SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

I implemented the SARIMA model in `time_series_model.py` specifically to capture:
- Seasonal patterns in air quality (daily, weekly, and annual cycles)
- Autocorrelation in AQI values
- Trend components in long-term air quality changes

This model was particularly effective for locations with strong seasonal patterns in air quality, such as areas affected by seasonal winds, temperature inversions, or cyclical human activities.

#### 4. Random Forest

My random forest implementation in `forest_model.py` provided:
- Robustness to outliers in the data
- Automatic feature selection
- Good performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning
- Built-in feature importance metrics

The random forest model served as a reliable benchmark and performed well in scenarios with diverse feature sets, making it an important part of my model arsenal.

#### 5. Linear Regression

I implemented linear regression in `linear_model.py` to serve as:
- A baseline for comparison with more complex models
- A highly interpretable model for feature relationship analysis
- A computationally efficient option for quick forecasting

While simple, the linear model provided valuable insights into direct feature relationships and served as an important check against overfitting with more complex models.

#### Model Selection Strategy

I designed `model_selector.py` to automatically evaluate and select the best model based on multiple metrics:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): For overall error magnitude
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): For average prediction deviation
- R-squared (R²): For explained variance assessment

This approach allowed my system to adapt to different cities and time periods, selecting the most appropriate model for each specific forecasting task. For example, SARIMA often performed better for locations with strong seasonal patterns, while gradient boosting excelled in areas with complex feature interactions.

### Integrating with Hopsworks

I used Hopsworks not only as a feature store but also as a model registry, which brought several key advantages:

1. **Model Versioning**: Each trained model was automatically versioned, allowing me to track performance changes over time.

2. **Model Serving**: Hopsworks simplified the deployment process by providing a consistent interface for model serving.

3. **Experiment Tracking**: I could compare different model configurations and their performance metrics in a centralized location.

4. **Feature-Model Lineage**: The integration between feature store and model registry allowed me to trace model predictions back to the exact feature versions used during training.

This infrastructure choice significantly improved the reproducibility and maintainability of my machine learning pipeline.

### Web Dashboard

I created a web dashboard in `app.py` that provides:
- Interactive visualizations of current and forecasted AQI levels
- Comparison views between different models' predictions
- Historical trend analysis
- Location-specific forecasts with configurable time horizons

The dashboard makes complex predictions accessible to non-technical users, translating model outputs into actionable insights about air quality conditions.

## Project Outcomes

My comprehensive approach to AQI prediction has delivered several important outcomes:

1. **Improved Forecast Accuracy**: By implementing multiple models and an intelligent selection mechanism, I've achieved prediction accuracy that exceeds standard approaches.

2. **Robust Time Series Handling**: The combination of SARIMA for seasonal patterns and neural networks for complex relationships has made the system resilient to various data challenges.

3. **Operational Efficiency**: The integration with Hopsworks has streamlined the MLOps workflow, reducing the time from data collection to model deployment.

4. **Explainable Predictions**: By maintaining simpler models alongside complex ones, I can provide users with interpretable insights about the factors driving AQI changes.

5. **Adaptable Architecture**: The system automatically selects the best model for different locations and time periods, adapting to the unique characteristics of each prediction scenario.

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation is robust, I've identified several areas for enhancement:

1. Incorporating satellite data for areas without monitoring stations
2. Implementing Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning
3. Adding ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple models
4. Developing a mobile application for on-the-go AQI forecasts
5. Integrating with smart home systems to automate air purification based on predictions

## Conclusion

My AQI-Predictor project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to environmental data modeling that combines domain knowledge with advanced machine learning techniques. The diverse model portfolio—neural networks, gradient boosting, SARIMA, random forest, and linear regression—ensures that the system can adapt to various prediction scenarios while maintaining high accuracy.

The integration with Hopsworks for feature storage and model management has been particularly valuable, enabling a more streamlined and reliable prediction system that follows modern MLOps practices. This architecture allows for continuous improvement while maintaining production reliability, demonstrating how machine learning can be applied effectively to environmental monitoring challenges.
